## About

### What is StreetCred ?
StreetCred is more than just your average news app.
Everyday, we pick, transcribe and translate with care any content from all over the web (news/blog article, podcasts, videos...) that matches with your interests, without censorship.
        `
### Premium mode
We give you free access to 3 new contents per day. In exchange, ads are displayed on our app, and after every read, we ask you to answer a simple one-question  survey related to the content you just read.
To enjoy StreetCred without ads, content limitations and surveys, you can subscribe to StreetCred Premium for only 5 euros per month.
        `
### Privay policy
We truly and deeply care about your private life and private data. That's why we don't collect, nor track, nor sell your data. We also don't store any data about you (geolocation and other information available on your phone). Ads and survey on StreetCred can't collect you data either.


### Ads
Although we care about diversity, respect and that we do our best to not offend or harm our users, we can't control and we are not responsible of the content of the ads that are displayed on StreetCred.

## Ok but seriously, what is StreetCred ?

StreetCred is one of the fiction app I made for my end-year project : a design fiction about animals-robots-artificial intelligence, called "Parlez-vous bestial ?" (do you speak beast lang?)
